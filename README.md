# Merkle-Tree
This program implements a merkle hash tree and proofs of inclusion and consistency.
A merkle tree is a binary tree of hashes, in which all the leaf nodes are the individual data elements. To construct a merkle tree, the initial data elements are first hashed using the merkle tree hash function to generate the leaf nodes of the tree. The resulting hashed data are subsequently hashed together in pairs to create the parent nodes of the leaf nodes. This process continues until it results in a single hash known as the merkle root.
